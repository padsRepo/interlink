<li>A note on the &quot;-r&quot; flag:
Something that needs to be documented is that since the -r command creates the $opt variable as the $1 paramater it will actually run any command including pads. So &quot;pads -r pads&quot; is a legal option. One thing overlooked when creating the command is how the case command globs strings. So &quot;-r ls&quot; will actually run the runList command because it sources the run_scripts.sh file and matches &quot;ls&quot; with the ls in &quot;runList&quot;. It may also be the regex used to find the function. There is either a fix, a workaround, or an entry to the manual to document the bug.
</li><li>Adding New Modules:
All new logic files added to ~/pads/src/ must be named by the flag or argument they represent.
</li><li>A note on how I tried to organize the syntax:
I wanted to following a syntax which follows the &lt;command&gt; &lt;module&gt; &lt;argument&gt; &lt;option&gt; pattern because I thought it would be easy to code and work with. It seems cryptic with one letter names, but the code is easy, and each function can have its own logic. Most of it being wrappers for more complex commands that already exist anyway, but I have a hard time remembering. I made it similar to pacman just because I liked it.
