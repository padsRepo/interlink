<li>PADS is General Purpose Artificial Intelligence designed to carry out every day business tasks. It&rsquo;s purpose is to provide book keeping, employee timesheets, client tracking, automation, etc. It can do double entry accounting for hybrid manufacturing companies. None of the data is loaded as Environment Variables, so your interaction with PADS is between you and it. It&rsquo;s original purpose was to serve as a website, with a relational historical database. Work on this project began in Python using the Django Framework on June 23, 2021 at 5:30pm. The accounting database first came online Oct. 13th, 2021 at 11:48pm. The Bash Syntax was first created by Joe Corso on May 4th, 2022. It was previously codenamed Project Eniac, to pay homage to the original project of the same name.
