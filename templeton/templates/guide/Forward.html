<p>I started programming with HTML, and CSS. My goal was to make an e-commerce website to sell the products I made blowing glass. I realized this might be something for me when I was awake at 5am feverishly typing in more lines of code. I then noticed how important it was to organize the code. Every week I was changing the directory structure. Slowly I learned python, the Django, then Flask, then Bash. When I learned Bash I felt like my power lever exceeded 9K. But I still had the same problem: a lot of code with no where to go. So I started to write wrappers in Bash, to call the function name rather then source a random file. Eventually it turned into a full command with options and arguments. Eventually, an new problem arose. How to remember all this stuff? So I decided to document everything. I fould texinfo because I wanted something to run in a terminal, online, and printout. So here we are, my comprehensive guide on all things I&rsquo;ve researched, and documented so far to this point. The man page my be outdated.
